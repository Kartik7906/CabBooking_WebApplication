Here is the revised version with corrected grammar and sentence formation:

This is a Cab Booking web application where we implement several microservices.

**Steps to create the backend:**

*Notes: If you have intermediate knowledge, follow these steps for better understanding:*

- Create a folder named `backend`. Inside it, set up a `.env` file and a `.gitignore` file. After that, initialize the project using `npm init`.
- Install `express`, `dotenv`, and `cors`. Create a file named `app.js`. After initializing the app with express, export this app so it can be used in other files.
- Create a file named `server.js`. Import the `http` module and the `app.js` file, then create a server using `http.createServer(app)`. Listen to the server on `process.env.PORT`.
- Update the entry point in the `package.json` file to `server.js`. Ensure to pass a callback function inside `server.listen` to log that the server is running on the specified port.
- Run the server using `nodemon server.js`.

Now, consider the models for this Uber app. There are various models such as `caption`, `user`, and `ride`. Let's move forward with Mongoose.

1) **Creating a User:**

First, we need to create a user. Authentication is necessary, which is why we need to install Mongoose. Now, we need to set up a database. To do this, create a folder named `db`. Inside the `db` folder, create a file named `db.js`, where we will connect to the database and export the Mongoose object.

Inside `db.js`, write a function called `connectToDB`. This function will connect to the database and return the Mongoose object. I assume you have knowledge of how to connect to the database using Mongoose. Don't forget to export this function so it can be used in other files. The export should look like this: `module.exports = connectToDB;`.

Remember to add the `MONGODB_URI` in the `.env` file, and make sure to catch any errors that may occur while connecting to the database.

Once you’ve written the `connectToDB` function, require it inside the `app.js` file and simply run the function to establish the connection to the database.

Now, let's create a folder where we will write all the schemas for our backend. Let’s name it `models`. Inside the `models` folder, create a file named `user.model.js` for the user schema. Create a schema called `userSchema`. This schema should have fields like `firstName`, `email`, `password`, and `socketId`. The `firstName` should contain two nested objects: `firstName` and `lastName`. The `firstName` is required, while the `lastName` is not. Both are strings, and also give them a `minlength` validation: `[3, 'First name must be at least 3 characters long']`.

**Note:** Install `bcrypt` and `jsonwebtoken` for authentication and encryption of the password, and token generation, respectively.

Inside this `userSchema`, add the following methods:

```javascript
userSchema.methods.generateAuthToken = function () {
  const token = jwt.sign({ _id: this._id }, process.env.SECRET_KEY);
  return token;
};

userSchema.methods.comparePassword = async function (password) {
  return await bcrypt.compare(password, this.password);
};

userSchema.statics.hashPassword = async function (password) {
  const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
};
```

Why do we use these methods? We use these methods to hash the password before saving it to the database. We use them to compare the password the user entered with the password stored in the database. We also use the `generateAuthToken` method to generate a token for the user when they log in. The `hashPassword` method ensures the password is securely stored in the database.

You might be wondering if we can also generate the token in the schema file, and the answer is yes, you can generate a token in the schema file.

**Note:** Remember to create a `password` field in your `userSchema` with `type: String` and `required: true`. Additionally, set `select: false` so the password is not returned when querying the user data. The updated `userSchema` will look like this:

```javascript
password: {
  type: String,
  required: true,
  select: false,
}
```

Why `select: false` in the password field? The answer is that when you query the user in the database, you don't want to return the password field. By using `select: false`, you can prevent the password field from being returned.

Now, simply export this schema and use it in the `user.controller.js` file.

---

4) Create a folder called `controllers`. Inside the `controllers` folder, create a file called `user.controller.js`. Inside this file, require the user schema as `userModel`. Write all the route logic in the controller folder.

Before we start with the route logic, create a folder called `routes`, and inside the `routes` folder, create a file called `user.route.js`. But why do we need this file? Inside this route file, we will create all the route logic for the user. We will export this file and use it. In this file, we will write POST, GET, and DELETE HTTP requests. 

Before writing routes in the `user.route.js` file, think about it for a moment— we also need an authenticator to check if the route is valid or not. To do this, we will use the `express-validator` package. First, install the `express-validator` package by running `npm install express-validator --save`. Now, inside the `user.route.js` file, require `express`, `Router` from `express.Router`, and `body` from `express-validator`.

I know you might not be familiar with `express-validator`, so let me explain it in simple terms. `express-validator` is a package that helps you validate the data coming from the request body. It checks if the data is valid or not. For example, if you are creating a user and sending the request body with name, email, and password, `express-validator` will help you check that the name is not empty.

Now, create a POST request to register the user, which should look like this:

```javascript
router.post('/register', [
    body('email').isEmail().withMessage("Invalid Email"),
    body('fullname.firstname').isLength({min: 3}).withMessage("First name should be at least 3 characters long"),
], userController.registerUser);
```

Now, you might be wondering, what is `userController.registerUser`? This is the function that will handle the POST request. Let me explain it simply: when you make a POST request to the `/register` route, `express-validator` will check the data coming from the request body. If the data is valid, it will call the `registerUser` function. If the data is not valid, it will return an error message.

Before moving to the `user.controller.js` file, remember to `module.exports = router;` at the end of the `user.route.js` file.

Now, create a folder called `services` and create a file named `user.service.js`. Inside this file, we will write all the logic to handle user data.

I know it may seem a bit confusing, but don’t worry, I’ll explain it in simple terms.

Here is the logic for `user.service.js`:

```javascript
const userModel = require("../models/user.model");

module.exports.createUser = async ({ firstname, lastname, email, password }) => {
  if (!firstname || !email || !password) {
    return { error: "Please fill all the fields" };
  }

  const user = new userModel({
    fullname: {
      firstname: firstname,
      lastname: lastname,
    },
    email,
    password,
  });

  return user;
};
```

Here is the logic for the `user.route.js` file:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router  = express.Router();
const { body } = require('express-validator');
const userController = require('../controllers/user.controller');

router.post('/register', [
    body('email').isEmail().withMessage("Invalid Email"),
    body('fullname.firstname').isLength({ min: 3 }).withMessage("First name should be at least 3 characters long"),
], userController.registerUser);

module.exports = router;
```

Finally, in the `user.controller.js` file:

```javascript
const userModel = require('../models/user.model');

module.exports.registerUser = async (req, res, next) => {
  // Here we write the logic to handle the user data
};
```
The provided code includes functions and routes related to user registration in an Express application, with validation and user creation logic.

The first function, `createUser`, is responsible for creating a new user object. It accepts an object containing `firstname`, `lastname`, `email`, and `password`. It performs a check to ensure that the `firstname`, `email`, and `password` fields are not empty, returning an error message if any of these required fields are missing. If all the required fields are provided, the function creates a new user object using the `userModel` (presumably a Mongoose model), which structures the user's full name under `fullname` with the `firstname` and `lastname`. The `email` and `password` are directly assigned. Once the user object is created, it is returned.

The second part is the Express route handler that sets up a POST endpoint at `/register` for user registration. The route includes validation checks using the `express-validator` library. Specifically, it validates that the `email` is a valid email address and that the `firstname` is at least three characters long. If the data doesn't pass these checks, error messages are returned. After successful validation, the `registerUser` controller function is invoked to handle the registration process.

The `registerUser` function is defined in the `user.controller.js` file but is currently empty. Typically, this function would handle the logic of checking for any validation errors, calling the `createUser` function to create a user object, saving that object to the database, and returning an appropriate response to the client (such as a success message or an error response if something goes wrong). It takes three parameters: `req` (the request object containing data from the client), `res` (the response object used to send a response back to the client), and `next` (which passes control to the next middleware if needed).

In summary, the `createUser` function handles the logic for creating a new user object, the router handles POST requests to `/register` with validation, and the `registerUser` controller function is meant to process the registration by saving the user to the database and sending a response, though its logic is not yet implemented.
