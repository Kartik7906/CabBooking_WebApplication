This is a Cab Booking web application where we implement some microservices:

Steps to create the backend:

Notes: If you have intermediate knowledge, follow these steps for better understanding:

- Create a folder named backend. Inside it, set up a .env file and a .gitignore file. After that, initialize the project using npm init.
- Install express, dotenv, and cors. Create a file named app.js. After initializing an app with express, export this app so it can be used in other files.
- Create a file named server.js. Import the http module and the app.js file, then create a server using http.createServer(app). Listen to the server on process.env.PORT.
- Update the entry point in the package.json file to server.js. Ensure to pass a callback function inside server.listen to log that the server is running on the specified port.
- Run the server using nodemon server.js.

Now, consider the models for this Uber app. There are various models such as caption, user, and ride. Let's move forward with Mongoose.

1) First, we need to create a user. Of course, authentication is necessary, which is why we need to install Mongoose.
    Now, we need to set up a database. To do this, create a folder named db. Inside the db folder, create a file named db.js, where we will connect to the database and export the Mongoose object.

    Inside db.js, write a function called connectToDB. This function will connect to the database and return the Mongoose object. I assume you have the knowledge of how to connect to the database using Mongoose. Don't forget to export this function so it can be used in other files. The export should look like this: module.exports = connectToDB;.

    Remember to add the MONGODB_URI in the .env file, and make sure to catch any errors that may occur while connecting to the database.

    Once youâ€™ve written the connectToDB function, require it inside the app.js file and simply run the function to establish the connection to the database.
