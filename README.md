This is a Cab Booking web application where we implement several microservices.

**Steps to create the backend:**

*Notes: If you have intermediate knowledge, follow these steps for better understanding:*

- Create a folder named `backend`. Inside it, set up a `.env` file and a `.gitignore` file. After that, initialize the project using `npm init`.
- Install `express`, `dotenv`, and `cors`. Create a file named `app.js`. After initializing the app with express, export this app so it can be used in other files.
- Create a file named `server.js`. Import the `http` module and the `app.js` file, then create a server using `http.createServer(app)`. Listen to the server on `process.env.PORT`.
- Update the entry point in the `package.json` file to `server.js`. Ensure to pass a callback function inside `server.listen` to log that the server is running on the specified port.
- Run the server using `nodemon server.js`.

Now, consider the models for this Uber app. There are various models such as `caption`, `user`, and `ride`. Let's move forward with Mongoose.

1) **Creating a User:**

First, we need to create a user. Authentication is necessary, which is why we need to install Mongoose. Now, we need to set up a database. To do this, create a folder named `db`. Inside the `db` folder, create a file named `db.js`, where we will connect to the database and export the Mongoose object.

Inside `db.js`, write a function called `connectToDB`. This function will connect to the database and return the Mongoose object. I assume you have knowledge of how to connect to the database using Mongoose. Don't forget to export this function so it can be used in other files. The export should look like this: `module.exports = connectToDB;`.

Remember to add the `MONGODB_URI` in the `.env` file, and make sure to catch any errors that may occur while connecting to the database.

Once you’ve written the `connectToDB` function, require it inside the `app.js` file and simply run the function to establish the connection to the database.

Now, let's create a folder where we will write all the schemas for our backend. Let’s name it `models`. Inside the `models` folder, create a file named `user.model.js` for the user schema. Create a schema called `userSchema`. This schema should have fields like `firstName`, `email`, `password`, and `socketId`. The `firstName` should contain two nested objects: `firstName` and `lastName`. The `firstName` is required, while the `lastName` is not. Both are strings, and also give them a `minlength` validation: `[3, 'First name must be at least 3 characters long']`.

**Note:** Install `bcrypt` and `jsonwebtoken` for authentication and encryption of the password, and token generation, respectively.

Inside this `userSchema`, add the following methods:

```javascript
userSchema.methods.generateAuthToken = function () {
  const token = jwt.sign({ _id: this._id }, process.env.SECRET_KEY);
  return token;
};

userSchema.methods.comparePassword = async function (password) {
  return await bcrypt.compare(password, this.password);
};

userSchema.statics.hashPassword = async function (password) {
  const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
};
```

Why do we use these methods? We use these methods to hash the password before saving it to the database. We use them to compare the password the user entered with the password stored in the database. We also use the `generateAuthToken` method to generate a token for the user when they log in. The `hashPassword` method ensures the password is securely stored in the database.

You might be wondering if we can also generate the token in the schema file, and the answer is yes, you can generate a token in the schema file.

**Note:** Remember to create a `password` field in your `userSchema` with `type: String` and `required: true`. Additionally, set `select: false` so the password is not returned when querying the user data. The updated `userSchema` will look like this:

```javascript
password: {
  type: String,
  required: true,
  select: false,
}
```

Why `select: false` in the password field? The answer is that when you query the user in the database, you don't want to return the password field. By using `select: false`, you can prevent the password field from being returned.

Now, simply export this schema and use it in the `user.controller.js` file.

4) Create a folder called `controllers`. Inside the `controllers` folder, create a file called `user.controller.js`. Inside this file, require the user schema as `userModel`. Write all the route logic in the controller folder.
